# About it

It's just for fun project. Code is awful, although I'm trying my best to write clean and maintanable code, due to my lack of experience in computer graphics programming on such a low-level (for me).

You may try to read it, to learn a thing or two about computer graphics programming (maybe when i'll get something interesting working). But, as for now, I highly recommend not doing that :).
